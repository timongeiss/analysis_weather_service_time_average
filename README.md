# Analysis of time averaged output fields from weather services

Weather services, such as the german weather service, often generate output parameters in their numerical weather forecast model runs that are stored in the metadata not as absolute values but as time averages over the model runtime. 
For many applications, however, the absolute values from the metadata are required.
This short python module discusses this connection and tries to explain which are the best case values that can be calculated as absolute values from the time average fields.
